# Leetcode
My solutions for different leetcode questions in Python.

## Overview
This repo includes solutions for different leetcode questions I have solved, divided into easy, medium and hard.  
Each folder is also divided into questions categories (i.e. Trees, Graphs, etc). More categories will be added as I solve more questions.<br><br>
The repo currently includes 21 problems.
